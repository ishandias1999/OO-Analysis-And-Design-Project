# OO-Analysis-And-Design-Project
This project was conducted in order to test our knowledge of the OO Analysis And Design Module. Basically we had to analyse a complex description of an music academy where there were many problems that needed to be solved before designing the application. Since this was a group project myself and my colleague took a week to plan this project and we broke it down to smaller and more understandable pieces. Therefore, after reducing the complexity of the project we finally designed the application and made changes as we kept working on it. Overall we achieved 93% and the lecturer was happy with our submission.
